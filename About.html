                Hello! Welcome to my page. Here's a list of fun facts that will give 
                you a glimpse into who I am.

                    Civil Air Patrol (CAP) is a non-profit organization that supports 
                    the U.S. Air Force and serves communities across the U.S. and I 
                    have had the opportunity to be a part of CAP for a little more 
                    than 3 years now.

                    One of my favorite pastime activities is reading. I enjoy 
                    fictional books with tales of princesses trapped in towers, 
                    dragons, and heroic princes who save the day! However, I also 
                    appreciate a good non-fiction book every now and then.
